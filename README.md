## Metrics to Evaluate Models
1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Itâ€™s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation.

    ```math
     \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
     ```

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error. It provides a measure of how spread out these residuals are, and it is in the same units as the target variable.

   ```math
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} 
   ```
3. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
   MAPE measures the size of the error in terms of percentage. It is calculated as the average of the absolute percentage errors.

   ```math
   \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right| 
   ```
